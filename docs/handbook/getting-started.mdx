## Introducing tracks

Tracks make it easy for new contributors to start their journey of learning and contributing to DAOhaus.

Tracks in our discord are broken down by `categories` and `channels`, which serve as focused spaces for open ideation, sharing, and knowledge transference (think meetspace coordination).

Roles are the "personas" used for participating in different tracks, making for a fun and easy way to engage in DAOhaus, contribute value, and level up... you're on your way DAOing it!

Here is a quick overview of the different **Roles** available:

| Name                         | Personas                                                                                   |
